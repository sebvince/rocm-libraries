    GRA writes (DDR->LDS) to the LDS that LRA0 reads from (LDS->VGPR).

    We don't know where in LDS GRA writes from. In theory we could determine
    where exactly each GRA instruction writes to, but currently this is too
    complicated and so we conservatively assume it always writes everywhere that
    a thread in the workgroup is reading from in LRA0. Thus we must ensure
    that every thread in every wave in the workgroup has finished all of its
    LRA0 instructions before GRA is issued.

    Exactly the same logic applies for the B operand. Note that there are no
    constraints between LRA0 and GRB, or between LRB0 and GRA, because the LDS
    used for A and B are completely separate.
